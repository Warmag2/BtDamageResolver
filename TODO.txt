	Open UI Issues

[FEATURE] Table-based UI layout is very slow and frowned upon these days - move to the current millennium and change everything to well-mannered <div>s.
[FEATURE] Move adding/deleting buttons around so that they are not outside the visual components they need to delete and/or not in strange places.

	Open Bugs

[BUG] Experienced some issues with weather effects. Needs further investigation.

[BUG] User needs to wait for import task to finish before using client, even if import task has finished at some point in the past.

[BUG] In multiplayer use, switching unit type with active invalid type properties puts the UI in a state where it is not obvious how one should proceed. Remote updates will reset the unit into the last known state, while user memory will still have the invalid state and user is unable to send updates.

		Could not reproduce

[BUG] Attacker heat is displayed for units other than Mech/AerospaceF
[COMMENT]: Can't find bug. Heat is displayed only for units which can take and produce heat. Need reproduction steps.

[BUG] Plasma rifle heat is not correct.
[COMMENT]: Can't find bug. Heat values seem correct. Need reproduction steps.
