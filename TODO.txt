	Open UI Issues

[FEATURE] Table-based UI layout is very slow and frowned upon these days - move to the current millennium and change everything to well-mannered <div>s.
[FEATURE] Move adding deleting buttons around so that they are not outside the visual components they need to delete and/or not in strange places.

	Open Bugs

[BUG] Refresh does not seem to work for these items:
- Unit list
- Unit entry background color (for error marking)
This is regression from performance updates. Don't know how to fix yet.

		Could not reproduce

[BUG] Attacker heat is displayed for units other than Mech/AerospaceF
[COMMENT]: Can't find bug. Heat is displayed only for units which can take and produce heat. Need reproduction steps.

[BUG] Plasma rifle heat is not correct.
[COMMENT]: Can't find bug. Heat values seem correct. Need reproduction steps.
