Trying out the latest build

After each commit to the master branch, a new pre-release NuGet package is automatically published to GitHub Packages. To try it out, follow the steps below:

    Create a Personal Access Token (classic) with at least read:packages scope.

    Add our package source to your local user-specific nuget.config file by running:

    dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/json-api-dotnet/index.json --name github-json-api --username YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME --password YOUR-PAT-CLASSIC

In the command above:

    Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME with the username you use to login your GitHub account.
    Replace YOUR-PAT-CLASSIC with the token your created above.

⚠️ If the above command doesn't give you access in the next step, remove the package source by running:

dotnet nuget remove source github-json-api

and retry with the --store-password-in-clear-text switch added.

Restart your IDE, open your project, and browse the list of packages from the github-json-api feed (make sure pre-release packages are included).
